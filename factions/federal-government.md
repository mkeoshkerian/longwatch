# The Federal Space Government

Humanity's great compromise—the minimum authority necessary to prevent space from becoming a battlefield.

## Structure

### Federal Council
15 members, weighted representation:
- 3 from Sino-Russian Sphere
- 3 from Western Hemisphere Alliance
- 2 from Pan-European Federation
- 2 from African Union
- 1 from Aligned States (rotating)
- 4 from off-Earth constituencies (2 Luna, 1 Mars, 1 outer system)

**Decisions require:** 10-vote majority for ordinary business, 12 for major initiatives, unanimous Earth blocs for constitutional changes.

### Federal Executive
**Secretary-General:** Elena Vasquez (Western Alliance)  
Appointed by Council, serves 6-year term.

### Federal Judiciary
Interprets Federal law, arbitrates jurisdictional disputes. Based on Luna.

### Federal Bureaucracy
Massive civil service managing space traffic, resource allocation, environmental standards, etc.

---

## Powers and Limitations

### The FSG Has Authority Over:
- All military spacecraft and weapons systems above 100km altitude
- Resource extraction licensing and dispute resolution
- Space traffic control and navigation standards
- Environmental protection (no WMDs in space, antimatter handling, etc.)
- First contact protocols and xenological policy
- **FTL technology** (sole possessor, heavily classified)

### The FSG Does NOT Have Authority Over:
- Earth-based governance (remains with blocs/nations)
- Internal settlement governance (though sets minimum standards)
- Corporate operations except when conflicting with Federal law
- Cultural or ideological matters

### In Practice
FSG authority degrades with distance:
- **Absolute** in Earth-Luna space
- **Strong** in inner system
- **Contested** at Jupiter
- **Essentially nonexistent** at Saturn

---

## Funding

The FSG is funded by:
- Mandatory contributions from Earth blocs (based on economic output)
- Licensing fees from resource extraction
- Transit fees
- Fines and penalties

**Budget:** Approximately 2% of combined Earth GDP, or ~$8 trillion annually (2225 dollars).

## FTL Monopoly

The Federal Government has **sole control** of FTL technology:

- The breakthrough occurred at a Federal research station (Ganymede, 2223)
- Immediately classified at highest level
- Dr. Okonkwo's team under permanent security protocols
- The UEFS *Prometheus* is the only FTL-capable vessel
- A second ship (*Magellan*) is under construction, won't be ready until 2227-2228

**Corporate espionage is constant threat:**
- Corporations know FTL exists (can't hide a ship that appeared at Ganymede)
- They know it involves exotic matter and warp field generation
- They DON'T know the specific configuration that makes it stable
- Corporate intelligence services are absolutely trying to steal it
- Some corporate observers on missions may have secondary objectives...
