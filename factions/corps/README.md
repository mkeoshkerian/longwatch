# Megacorporations

Megacorps are "major players and pivotal" in this setting. They're not quite nation-states, but they have enormous resources, their own agendas, and in some cases their own FTL-capable ships.

## Role in the Setting

- Provide resources, technology, infrastructure that government can't
- Have interests that may align or conflict with Earth federal authority
- Especially powerful in the Belt and outer system where government reach is weak
- May have funded part of your mission—with strings attached

## Corps to Define

As the campaign develops, add individual corp files here. Consider:

- **Resource/Mining Corps:** Control Belt operations, raw materials
- **Aerospace/Shipbuilding Corps:** Build the ships, maybe including yours
- **Tech/Communications Corps:** Control networks, AI, software
- **Biotech/Life Support Corps:** Critical for colony survival
- **Financial Corps:** Fund expeditions, hold debt

## Questions to Answer

When creating a corp:
- What do they control or produce?
- Where are they strongest (Earth, Mars, Belt, Jupiter)?
- What's their relationship with the federal government?
- What do they want from the Signal mission?
- Who are the key figures?
