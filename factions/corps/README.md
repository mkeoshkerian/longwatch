# Megacorporations

In 2225, megacorporations are quasi-sovereign entities with economic might rivaling Earth blocs. They are truly transnational—not aligned with any single bloc.

## Corporate Power and Limitations

Megacorps operate under Federal charter but test boundaries constantly:

### What They Can Do:
- Operate across entire system with minimal restriction
- Maintain private security forces
- Conduct proprietary research
- Influence Federal policy through lobbying and economic leverage
- Control vast resources and populations

### What They (Officially) Can't Do:
- Violate Federal law
- Wage war on each other (2189 was a "security incident")
- Develop prohibited technologies (AGI, antimatter weapons, FTL)
- Claim sovereignty over territory
- Obstruct Federal military operations

### Reality
The line between permitted and prohibited is blurry. Corporations push boundaries, Federal Government pushes back, compromise happens. It's a dance of power between entities that need each other but don't fully trust each other.

## The FTL Problem

Corporations desperately want FTL technology:
- They know it exists (the *Prometheus* isn't exactly subtle)
- They know the basics (exotic matter, warp field generation)
- They DON'T know the specific quantum configuration that makes it stable
- Corporate R&D teams are approaching the problem from different angles
- None have cracked it yet
- Espionage against the Federal program is constant
- **Some corporate "observers" on your mission may have secondary objectives...**

This creates enormous tension. The corporation that cracks FTL—or steals the secret—gains incalculable strategic advantage.
