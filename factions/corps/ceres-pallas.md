# Ceres-Pallas Consortium

**Headquarters:** Pallas Station  
**Primary Business:** Asteroid mining, resource extraction, refining  
**Revenue:** $670 billion annually  
**Employees:** 1.8 million (plus contract workers)

---

## Overview

Backed by Sino-Russian interests, C-PC controls 30% of Belt production. Started as Chinese mining venture in 2090s, grew through aggressive acquisition and occasional violence.

---

## Power

- Dominates critical resources: iron, nickel, platinum group metals, water ice
- Can throttle supply to pressure Earth blocs or competitors
- Controls Pallas Station (250,000 population company town)
- Major presence on Vesta (400,000, heavy industry)

---

## Reputation

Brutal, exploitative, effective. Labor conditions are legal but harsh. Triggered the 2189 Belt War defending claims.

## The Belt War (2189)

When a rival attempted to claim-jump C-PC operations, the Consortium responded with armed force. Three weeks of corporate fleet combat before Federal intervention.

**Result:** 
- Demonstrated corporate fleets could challenge Federal authority
- C-PC retained contested claims
- Established precedent that Federal Government would intervene but not quickly
- Created current uneasy equilibrium

---

## Labor Practices

C-PC is notorious for:
- Minimum legal wages (barely)
- Long rotations with minimal breaks
- Debt-bonding practices that trap workers
- Aggressive suppression of labor organizing
- "Company town" economics on Pallas

Not technically illegal. Not remotely ethical.

## FTL Interest

Less aggressive than Han-Lockheed on FTL—their business is resource extraction, not ship-building. But:
- Funding construction of *Venture II* (FTL-capable ship, completion 2226-2227)
- Clearly have R&D program
- Would benefit enormously from interstellar resource access
