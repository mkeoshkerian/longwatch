## Overview

Formed from merger of Chinese Han Aerospace and American Lockheed Martin in 2145, Han-Lockheed dominates high-end spacecraft construction. If you need an advanced vessel, they're likely involved.

---

## Power

- Controls the Galilean Shipyards (between Ganymede and Callisto)
- Operates New Shanghai on Titan (their corporate fiefdom)
- Builds most Federal and corporate spacecraft
- Federal Government needs them more than they need Federal Government

---

## Reputation

Ruthlessly efficient, politically connected, willing to bend rules but smart enough not to break them obviously.

---

## FTL Interest

Han-Lockheed is **desperate** to crack FTL:
- They build spacecraft—FTL-capable ships would be ultimate product
- Extensive R&D program trying to replicate the breakthrough
- Almost certainly have intelligence assets trying to steal Federal secrets
- New Shanghai provides convenient base for questionable activities outside Federal oversight

---

## Saturn Operations

New Shanghai on Titan is nominally a hydrocarbon mining operation. In reality:
- Corporate fiefdom with no real Federal oversight
- Money laundering hub
- Black market nexus
- Refuge for those fleeing Federal jurisdiction

The Federal Government pretends it's legitimate. Han-Lockheed pretends to follow rules. Everyone knows the truth.

## Relationship with Federal Government

Complicated. Han-Lockheed:
- Builds Federal ships (including components of the *Prometheus*)
- Resents Federal FTL monopoly
- Lobbies constantly for "technology sharing"
- Almost certainly engaged in espionage

The Federal Government:
- Needs Han-Lockheed's manufacturing capacity
- Suspects their espionage activities
- Can't afford to confront them directly
- Watches them very carefully
