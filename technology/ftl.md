# Faster-Than-Light Travel

The crown jewel of human achievement and strategic asset beyond measure.

## The Breakthrough (2223)

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo's team at Ganymede Research Station was working on exotic matter for radiation shielding. An unexpected quantum fluctuation in their experiment created a microscopic, stable warp bubble for 0.3 seconds.

**Critical facts:**
- They **barely understand why it worked**
- Can reproduce it but the theory is incomplete
- The key insight is a specific quantum state that's incredibly difficult to achieve and maintain
- Federal government immediately classified everything
- Dr. Okonkwo's entire team placed under permanent security protocols

## The Science (Simplified)

The breakthrough cracked a variant of the Alcubierre warp drive concept. By creating a stable bubble of warped spacetime around a vessel, the ship doesn't move faster than light—spacetime itself contracts ahead and expands behind, carrying the bubble forward.

**Key requirements:**
- **Massive Energy:** Creating warp bubble requires enormous power
- **Exotic Matter:** Negative energy density field generators (the real breakthrough)
- **Precise Configuration:** The specific quantum state that makes it stable (the secret)

## Current Capability

### FTL-Capable Vessels: ONE

**UEFS *Prometheus*** (Prometheus-class explorer, commissioned 2224)
- Humanity's first and only FTL-capable ship
- Your ship

**Under Construction:**
- UEFS *Magellan* (Prometheus-class) — won't be ready until 2227-2228

That's it. No other FTL ships exist. No jump gates. No corporate FTL vessels.

## FTL Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | ~2 light-years per subjective day |
| Signal distance | ~45-50 light-years |
| Transit time (one way) | 22-23 days |
| Cooldown between jumps | 48+ hours |
| Accuracy | Decreases with distance; can't jump into planetary systems safely |
| Course changes | None possible once bubble forms |

## Why Federal Government Has Monopoly

**Right place, right time:**
- Breakthrough happened at Federal research station (Ganymede)
- Immediate classification before results could leak
- Corporate labs are working on FTL but approaching from different angles
- None have hit on the right exotic matter configuration

**Corporate espionage is constant:**
- Corporations KNOW FTL exists (can't hide a ship that appeared at Ganymede)
- They know it involves exotic matter and warp field generation
- They DON'T know the specific configuration that makes it stable
- Corporate intelligence services are absolutely trying to steal it
- Some corporate observers on your mission may have secondary objectives...

## Strategic Implications

The *Prometheus* is:
- One-of-a-kind strategic asset
- If lost, humanity's FTL capability is gone for years
- Simultaneously flagship and prototype
- Target of every corporate intelligence service

This mission is:
- First crewed FTL voyage at interstellar distance (no prior testing at this range)
- First contact potential
- Only FTL-capable ship humanity has
- 3-4 month mission with no communication possible
- If something goes wrong, there is no rescue

## What We Don't Know

Even the Federal scientists aren't certain about:
- Long-term effects of extended FTL travel
- Whether the drive will function reliably at 45+ light-year distances
- What happens if the drive fails mid-transit
- Whether there are range limits beyond theoretical models

You are the test case.
