# Faster-Than-Light Travel

FTL is the key technology that makes your mission possible—and its rarity is what makes your mission matter.

## The Basics

- FTL exists but is "barely attainable"
- Developed ~30-40 years ago
- Based on something "alcubierre-adjacent"—manipulating spacetime to move without violating relativity

## How It Works (Draft)

[TBD: We put a pin in the exact mechanics. Current thinking:]

### Jump Gates
- FTL requires massive infrastructure to initiate
- You can't just spin up a warp bubble anywhere—you need a jump gate
- Gates are enormously expensive, require huge power sources
- Current gate locations:
  - Earth-Luna L5 (primary)
  - Mars orbit
  - Near Ganymede (corporate-funded, newest)

### The Drive Itself
- Ships need an FTL drive to travel, but also need a gate to start
- Drives are ruinously expensive—only governments and top-tier corps can afford them
- [TBD: Can you drop out of FTL anywhere, or only at another gate?]
- [TBD: What's travel time like? Days? Weeks?]

### Fuel/Power
- [TBD: What powers FTL? Exotic matter? Antimatter? Something else?]
- Fuel is scarce, another limiting factor

## Why This Matters

- Only a handful of FTL-capable ships exist
- Your ship is one of them—this makes you rare and valuable
- The mission to investigate the Signal is a one-way commitment of an irreplaceable asset
- If something goes wrong, rescue is not coming quickly

## Open Questions

- Can you return from interstellar space, or is this potentially one-way?
- What happens if the drive is damaged far from a gate?
- Are there limits to range?
