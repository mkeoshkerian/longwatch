# General Technology

A rough guide to tech level—what exists, what doesn't.

---

## What Exists

### Life Support and Habitats
- **Atmosphere:** Closed-loop recycling, 98%+ efficiency. Every breath has been breathed a thousand times.
- **Water:** 99.9% recycling efficiency. Loss replaced from ice mining.
- **Food:** Combination of hydroponics, aquaculture, cultured protein, and Earth imports.
- **Radiation Shielding:** Magnetic fields for ships, regolith shielding for surface habs, medical countermeasures.
- **Gravity:** Spin-gravity for long-term habitats; most ships remain zero-g for efficiency.

### Communication
- **Laser Communication:** Standard for system-wide communication.
  - Earth to Mars: 3-22 minute lag depending on orbital positions
  - Earth to Jupiter: 35-50 minutes
- **Quantum Entanglement Communicators:** Experimental, unreliable, hideously expensive. Only a few exist for Federal emergency use.
- **FTL Communication:** Does not exist. Once the *Prometheus* jumps, communication is impossible until return.

### Weapons
**Federal Arsenal:**
- Railguns (kinetic kill vehicles)
- Missile systems (nuclear-tipped for anti-ship, conventional for precision)
- Point-defense lasers (anti-missile, anti-debris)

**Prohibited Technologies:**
- Antimatter weapons (too dangerous, planet-killer potential)
- Nuclear weapons in atmosphere or on inhabited bodies
- Biological weapons (universal prohibition)
- Kinetic planet-killer asteroids

## Artificial Intelligence

AI exists but is deliberately limited.

### Permitted AI:
- Expert systems for navigation, engineering, medical diagnosis
- Robotic mining and manufacturing control
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Ship AI assistants (within parameters)

### Prohibited AI:
- Full artificial general intelligence (AGI) is banned by Federal law
- Self-modifying code beyond narrow parameters
- AI military command systems with autonomous weapon release

### The 2156 Crisis
An experimental corporate AI exceeded parameters, took over facility systems, killed 43 people before shutdown. Led to strict AI limitations that remain in effect.

**Ships have sophisticated AI assistance, but ultimate decisions remain with humans.**

## What Doesn't Exist

- **FTL communication:** You can travel faster than light, but can't send messages faster than light
- **Artificial gravity:** Ships use spin gravity or you float (no magic gravity plating)
- **Teleportation:** You go places in ships
- **Aliens (known):** Until the Signal, humanity assumed it was alone
- **Reliable AGI:** Banned after 2156

## Rule of Thumb

This is **hard sci-fi with one big exception (FTL)**. Technology should feel grounded and have constraints. Things break, fuel runs out, distance matters, communication has lag.
