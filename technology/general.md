# General Technology

A rough guide to tech level—what exists, what doesn't.

## What Exists

### Spaceflight
- Reliable interplanetary travel (weeks to months for major routes)
- FTL travel (rare, expensive, infrastructure-dependent)
- Space stations and habitats of varying sizes
- Asteroid mining at industrial scale

### Computing & AI
- [TBD: How advanced is AI?]
- Ubiquitous computing, networks throughout inner system
- Communication is still limited by light speed (no FTL comms)
- Ship AI assistants? How autonomous?

### Medicine
- Life extension? Or normal human lifespans?
- Space medicine well-developed (bone loss, radiation)
- [TBD: Genetic modification? Cybernetics?]

### Energy
- Fusion power (probably—needed for civilization at this scale)
- Solar power in inner system
- [TBD: What powers FTL? Exotic matter?]

### Habitation
- Domed cities, orbital stations, underground settlements
- Closed-loop life support for long missions
- [TBD: Terraforming progress on Mars?]

## What Doesn't Exist

- **FTL communication:** You can travel faster than light, but you can't send messages faster than light. Once you leave, you're out of contact until you return.
- **Artificial gravity:** Ships use spin gravity or you float. [TBD: Or does artificial gravity exist?]
- **Teleportation:** You go places in ships.
- **Aliens (known):** Until the Signal, humanity assumed it was alone.

## Rule of Thumb

This is **hard sci-fi with one big exception (FTL)**. Technology should feel grounded and have constraints. Things break, fuel runs out, distance matters.
