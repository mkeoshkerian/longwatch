# Ships and Propulsion

## Conventional Propulsion

For non-FTL travel, humanity uses fusion drives as standard:

### Fusion Torch Drives
- Controlled fusion reaction directing plasma exhaust
- Enables 0.1-0.3g constant acceleration
- Inner system trips measured in weeks
- Jupiter run takes 2-3 months

### Ion Drives
- For cargo and efficient long-haul
- Slow but fuel-efficient

### Chemical Rockets
- Still used for surface-to-orbit on Earth and Mars
- Mostly replaced by orbital elevators on Luna

| Explorer-class | No | 11 | Deep space exploration, no FTL |

### Civilian/Corporate

- **Freighters:** Bulk cargo between major ports
- **Mining vessels:** Belt and Jupiter operations
- **Passenger liners:** Earth-Mars-Belt routes
- **Corporate security:** Varies widely in capability

See [ship.md](../mission/ship.md) for full specifications.

**Key facts:**
- 450 meters length
- Crew complement: 180
- Humanity's first and only FTL-capable vessel
- Prometheus-class (only one exists; second under construction)
- Named for the Titan who brought fire to humanity—with all the implications that carries
