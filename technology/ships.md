# Ships

## Ship Classes (General)

### Interplanetary (Common)
- **Freighters:** Bulk cargo between major ports
- **Mining vessels:** Belt and Jupiter operations
- **Passenger liners:** Earth-Mars-Belt routes
- **Military/patrol:** System defense, anti-piracy
- **Research vessels:** Science missions, surveys

### FTL-Capable (Rare)
- Only a handful exist
- Government exploration vessels (like yours)
- Top-tier corporate flagships
- [TBD: How many total? 5? 10? 20?]

## Propulsion (Sublight)

[TBD: What do normal ships use?]
- Fusion drives? Ion drives? 
- Nuclear thermal?
- Travel times within the system?

## Design Considerations

- No artificial gravity (or spin gravity only?)
- Radiation shielding critical, especially near Jupiter
- Life support for long voyages
- Communication delays mean ships must be self-sufficient

## Your Ship

See [/mission/ship.md](/mission/ship.md) for details on your specific vessel.

## Weapons

[TBD: How militarized is space?]
- Are civilian ships armed?
- What do military vessels carry?
- Is your ship armed? How heavily?
