<h3>Origins: The Kepler Mutiny</h3>

Longwatch began during the Belt War of 2189. Captain Elena Vandenberg of the Federal cruiser Kepler received orders to support Vanguard Mining—not because they were right, but because Western Alliance interests aligned with theirs.

Vandenberg refused. "Federal vessels do not serve bloc interests. We will protect civilian installations. We will not take sides in corporate conflict."

Fleet Command relieved her. Her XO was ordered to comply. He refused too. Then the weapons officer. Then the navigator. One by one, the entire crew chose court martial over complicity.

<div class="quote">"We serve humanity. We serve no bloc."</div>

The compromise: charges dropped, but Vandenberg would never command a regular vessel again. Instead, the Council gave her something new to build.

<h3>Selection: Breaking and Remaking</h3>

<b>The Numbers:</b>
• ~2,000 applications per year
• ~400 accepted to Academy
• ~60 graduate
• 85% washout rate

<b>Phase One (Months 1-4):</b> The Stripping. No national flags, no bloc insignia, teams assembled to maximize cultural friction. The academics are brutal. The psych evaluations break people—finding loyalties you're hiding from yourself.

<b>Phase Two (Months 5-12):</b> The Crucible. Eight months on a training vessel. Real patrols, real emergencies, real isolation. You don't know which emergencies are drills. The ones who make it aren't the toughest—they're the ones who reach for crewmates instead of countrymen.

<b>Phase Three (Months 13-18):</b> The Oath. Vandenberg Hall, Luna. Black walls, stars through the viewport.

<div class="quote">"I am Longwatch. I serve no nation, no bloc, no tribe. I carry humanity into the dark, and I will bring it home again."</div>

<h3>Traditions</h3>

<b>The Symbol:</b> Circle containing a single point—a star from great distance. No colors. Worn as collar pin.

<b>The Three Silences:</b> Where you're from, who you voted for, what god you pray to. Not forbidden—but speaking of them marks you as uncommitted.

<b>The Long Table:</b> Every vessel has one mess table. All ranks eat together. Captain next to ensign.

<b>Heritage Hours:</b> Four hours weekly for native languages and cultural practices. The point isn't suppression—it's compartmentalization.

<h3>The Breakthrough (2223)</h3>

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo's team at Ganymede Research Station was working on exotic matter for radiation shielding. An unexpected quantum fluctuation created a microscopic stable warp bubble for 0.3 seconds.

<b>They barely understand why it worked.</b>

They can reproduce it, but the theory is incomplete. The Federal government immediately classified everything. Dr. Okonkwo's team remains under permanent security protocols.

<h3>How It Works</h3>

Alcubierre-variant warp drive. The ship doesn't move faster than light—spacetime contracts ahead and expands behind, carrying the bubble forward.

<b>Requirements:</b>
• Massive energy (dedicated antimatter reactor)
• Exotic matter (negative energy density field generators)
• Precise quantum configuration (THE secret)

<h3>Specifications</h3>

<div class="mono">Speed: ~2 light-years per subjective day
Range: ~25 light-years before instability
Cooldown: 48+ hours between jumps
Course changes: None once bubble forms
Signal distance: ~45-50 light-years
Transit time: 22-23 days each way</div>

<h3>Jump Options</h3>

The drive can theoretically sustain a bubble indefinitely. But it's never been tested beyond a few days.

<b>Option A - One Sustained Jump:</b>
• 23 days straight in the bubble
• More fuel-efficient
• Completely unproven at this duration
• If something fails mid-transit, no way to stop

<b>Option B - Multiple Short Jumps:</b>
• Jump a few light-years, drop out, cooldown, repeat
• Takes longer, burns more fuel
• Can check systems between jumps
• Safer but tighter margins

Both approaches are unproven at interstellar distances. The crew must choose.

<h3>Precision and Emergence</h3>

The bubble can collapse intentionally at any point. BUT precision degrades with distance. At 5 light-years, you target a region. At 45 light-years, you're aiming at a general area.

Emerging too close to a gravity well is catastrophic. You drop out at safe distance and approach on conventional drives.

<h3>Failure Scenarios</h3>

If the drive fails mid-transit: bubble collapses, you drop into normal space. In interstellar void, the nearest star is light-years away. Fusion drives at 0.3g take decades.

If fixable, you can attempt re-jump. If not, you're stranded.

<h3>Corporate Espionage</h3>

Corporations KNOW FTL exists. They know it involves exotic matter and warp fields. They DON'T know the quantum configuration.

Han-Lockheed is desperate to crack it. At least one corporate observer on Prometheus has secondary objectives.`

<h3>Discovery</h3>

<b>Date:</b> September 15, 2225
<b>Detection:</b> Deep Space Monitoring Array Epsilon-7 (outer Belt)
<b>Time:</b> 0342 UTC

Automated systems detected anomalous radio emission from beyond the solar system. Initial assumption: equipment malfunction. Cross-check confirmed: the signal was real, external, and artificial.

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

<div class="mono">Origin: ~45-50 light-years distant
Direction: Toward Tau Ceti (offset 15°—NOT from Tau Ceti)
Frequency: 1420 MHz (hydrogen line)
Pattern: Mathematical sequences: primes, then complex concepts
Nature: Directed transmission spillover
Duration: Continuous since detection</div>

<h3>The Key Insight</h3>

<b>The signal isn't meant for us.</b>

We're detecting spillover from a targeted transmission. Like overhearing a conversation in another room. Like radio waves that leaked past Earth during our broadcast era.

Someone is talking to someone else. We're eavesdropping.

<h3>What It Proves</h3>

• We are not alone
• Someone is transmitting
• They use mathematics and the hydrogen line (universal concepts)
• They have technology at least comparable to ours

<h3>What We Don't Know</h3>

• What is sending it?
• Is the source still active, or ancient echoes?
• Is it a beacon? A warning? Routine communication?
• Do they know we exist?
• <b>Do they know we're coming?</b>

<h3>The Decision</h3>

Federal Council vote: 13-2 to authorize mission.

The minority's concerns were not trivial. Some argued humanity should wait, study remotely, develop better FTL. Others argued first contact was too important to delay—whoever makes contact first shapes the relationship forever.

The debate continues. The mission proceeds anyway.`

<h3>The Political Reality</h3>

When the Federal Council approved the mission, multiple corporations demanded representation. Han-Lockheed, Ceres-Pallas, AtmoTech, others. Each argued they had scientific expertise to contribute.

Saying no to all was politically impossible. Saying yes to one but not another would cause uproar.

<b>Result:</b> Five slots, distributed across major corporate interests.

<h3>The Complication</h3>

The corporations are <b>rivals</b>. Han-Lockheed and Ceres-Pallas aren't coordinating—they're competing. Their observers may be watching each other as much as the FTL drive.

<h3>The Realistic Breakdown</h3>

<div class="mono">Genuine Scientists: 1-2 (No secret orders. Just doing their job.)
Passive Intel: 1-2 ("Report what you learn. Don't take risks.")
Active Threat: 1 (Espionage mission. Willing to act.)</div>

<h3>What You Know</h3>

• Five corporate observers are aboard
• Longwatch vetted them—real credentials
• Everyone assumes at least one has secondary objectives
• You don't know which one
• You don't know how far they'll go

<h3>What They Want</h3>

FTL technology. The corporation that cracks it—or steals it—gains incalculable advantage.

Han-Lockheed builds spacecraft. FTL-capable ships would be the ultimate product.

At least one observer is gathering intelligence on the drive systems. The Federal security services know this. The observers know they're being watched.

The game plays out 45 light-years from anyone who could intervene.

<h3>Specific Identities</h3>

<b>TBD</b> — To be developed during play.`

                    content: `Three weeks that changed everything.

<h3>The Cause</h3>

A dispute over mining claims in the Belt between Ceres-Pallas Consortium and Vanguard Mining Group. Both had invested heavily in the same asteroid field. Neither would yield.

Corporate lawyers failed. Corporate negotiators failed. Corporate security did not.

<h3>The Fighting</h3>

What began as armed standoff escalated into actual combat between corporate fleets. Ships were destroyed. Stations were damaged. Perhaps two thousand people died—mostly workers caught in crossfire.

The fighting spread across multiple claim sites as each side reinforced positions and launched reprisals.

<h3>Federal Response</h3>

Federal forces were spread thin. The closest significant naval presence was weeks away. By the time Federal ships arrived in force, the fighting had largely exhausted itself.

The intervention restored order but revealed an uncomfortable truth: <b>corporate military capabilities could challenge Federal authority</b>, and the Federal Government lacked resources to police the entire solar system.

<h3>The Kepler Mutiny</h3>

During the conflict, the Federal cruiser Kepler under Captain Elena Vandenberg received orders to support Vanguard—not because Vanguard was right, but because Western Alliance bloc interests aligned with theirs.

Vandenberg refused. Her entire crew chose court martial over complicity.

<div class="quote">"Federal vessels do not serve bloc interests."</div>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

<b>Reforms:</b> Corporate security forces nominally limited to "defensive" capabilities. Federal military presence in outer system increased.

<b>Reality:</b> Little changed. "Defensive" proved elastic. Budget constraints kept Federal increases marginal.

<b>Legacy:</b> The Belt War proved corporations could fight the Federal Government to a standstill. The Kepler Mutiny led to Longwatch's founding—an organization that would serve humanity, not blocs or corporations.`

<h3>The Prelude</h3>

By 2038, Taiwan was the chokepoint of global chip supply—its foundries produced the majority of advanced semiconductors. For Beijing, this dependency was intolerable. For Taipei, it was their only protection. For Washington, it was a commitment they'd maintained for decades without ever deciding what it meant.

<h3>The Strike</h3>

September 15, 2038. Not the amphibious assault that war planners anticipated—something subtler.

Chinese special forces, inserted over preceding weeks through civilian cover, launched coordinated attacks on Taiwan's command infrastructure. Cyberattacks disabled communications and power. By dawn, Taipei was in chaos and President Tsai Ming-hui was dead.

<h3>The American Response</h3>

Admiral Morrison of the Seventh Fleet faced the decision his career had prepared him for. But the situation wasn't what the plans anticipated.

This wasn't a conventional invasion contestable at sea—the critical damage was already done. Chinese forces had established defensive positions but hadn't attacked American assets. Beijing's message was explicit: <b>intervention means general war</b>.

The fleet held position. No American forces engaged.

By nightfall, organized resistance had collapsed.

<h3>The Aftermath</h3>

<b>Taiwan:</b> Two million fled into exile. The occupation was harsh initially, then evolved into sophisticated integration—economic benefits combined with political suppression.

<b>America:</b> Credibility in Asia shattered. Allies concluded they couldn't rely on American protection. Japan and South Korea began their own nuclear programs within the decade.

<b>China:</b> Emboldened. The Sino-Russian partnership accelerated toward full integration.

<h3>The Debate</h3>

Was Morrison right?

<b>Critics:</b> American credibility was destroyed. Allies were abandoned. Authoritarians were emboldened.

<b>Defenders:</b> Intervention might have meant nuclear war. Taiwan was already lost. The critics are volunteering other people's children for uncertain outcomes.

Both arguments contain truth. The question has no answer.

<h3>The Diaspora</h3>

The government-in-exile operates from Los Angeles. They maintain archives, publish alternative histories, wait for restoration that most privately know will never come.

Their children sometimes visit Taiwan as tourists, speaking Mandarin with foreign accents, looking for a homeland that exists only in memory.`
