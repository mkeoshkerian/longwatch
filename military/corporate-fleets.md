# Corporate Security Fleets

Corporations maintain "security" forces for "asset protection." Some are larger than small nations' navies.

## The Legal Gray Zone

Corporate fleets exist in complicated legal territory:
- Officially limited to defensive systems
- In practice, armed to teeth
- Federal Government can't afford confrontation
- Corporations provide too much economic value

**Result:** Cold peace where everyone pretends to follow rules while preparing for the rules to break.

## The Problem

Corporate fleets demonstrated during the 2189 Belt War that they can:
- Match Federal forces in localized engagements
- Operate effectively without Federal coordination
- Protect corporate interests through military force

Federal authority is somewhat notional in the outer system because they can't actually enforce it against a determined corporate fleet.

## Prohibited (Officially)

Corporate fleets are NOT supposed to have:
- FTL capability (Federal monopoly)
- Nuclear weapons above certain yield
- Antimatter weapons
- Fleet-scale offensive formations

**Reality:** At least some of these restrictions are being violated. The Federal Government knows. Corporations know the Federal Government knows. Everyone maintains the fiction.
