## Capabilities and Limitations

### Strengths:
- Technological edge over any corporate fleet
- Unified command structure
- Legal authority
- Professional, well-trained personnel

### Weaknesses:
- Can't be everywhere simultaneously
- Political constraints limit aggressive action
- Corporate fleets sometimes equal or superior in specific areas
- Declining budget pressures

**The Belt War exposed reality:** UEF can win any single engagement but can't control all space simultaneously.

## Federal Police and Anti-Piracy Forces

Distinct from UEF military—these are law enforcement:

- **Space Traffic Authority:** 50,000 personnel, 200 patrol craft
- **Federal Marshals:** 8,000 personnel, investigating federal crimes
- **Anti-Piracy Task Force:** 15,000 personnel, 80 dedicated patrol vessels

Undermanned for the vastness of space they're supposed to police. Response times can be days or weeks.
