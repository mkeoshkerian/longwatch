# LONGWATCH

The elite within the elite—Federal Space Government's exploration and first contact service.

## Origins: The Kepler Mutiny

The official founding date is March 15, 2190, but Longwatch really began six months earlier during the Belt War.

The Federal cruiser *Kepler* was operating near Vesta when corporate fleets from Ceres-Pallas Consortium and Vanguard Mining Group began exchanging fire. Captain Elena Vandenberg received orders from Fleet Command to support Vanguard — not because Vanguard was in the right, but because Western Alliance interests aligned with theirs.

Vandenberg refused.

Her crew was mixed — Chinese navigator, European weapons officer, Brazilian XO, American captain. Half of them had family in Belt settlements that would be caught in crossfire if the Federal fleet took sides. Vandenberg looked at her orders, looked at her crew, and transmitted back: "Federal vessels do not serve bloc interests. We will protect civilian installations and escort non-combatants. We will not take sides in corporate conflict."

Fleet Command relieved her of duty. Her XO, Commander Santos, was ordered to assume command and comply.

Santos refused too.

Then the weapons officer. Then the navigator. One by one, the senior staff of the *Kepler* chose court martial over complicity. The ship went dark for six hours — loss of communication, officially. In reality, they were voting. When *Kepler* came back online, the entire crew had signed a statement: "We serve humanity. We serve no bloc."

The Belt War ended a week later. Vandenberg and her officers faced tribunal. The political situation was delicate — they'd disobeyed direct orders, but they'd also become heroes to the frontier settlements they'd protected. Executing them would spark unrest across the Belt and Jupiter.

The compromise: charges dropped, but Vandenberg would never command a regular Federal vessel again.

Instead, she was given something else.

## The Founding: Vandenberg's Bargain

Federal Council was shaken by how quickly the Belt War exposed the cracks. Bloc loyalties had nearly torn the fleet apart. What happened on *Kepler* was insubordination — but it was also the only Federal vessel that had acted *Federal*.

Vandenberg was summoned to Luna. The Council offered her a deal: design something new. A small force, separate from the regular fleet, with a single mandate — go where politics cannot follow.

She had three conditions:

1. Longwatch selects its own personnel. No bloc quotas, no political appointments.
2. Longwatch operates beyond Jupiter. The inner system belongs to the regular fleet and its politics. The frontier belongs to us.
3. Longwatch answers to the Council directly, not Fleet Command.

The Council agreed. Vandenberg had one year to build it.

She started with the *Kepler* crew — the ones who'd stood with her. Forty-seven officers and enlisted who'd chosen court martial over bloc loyalty. They became the first Longwatch cadre, the instructors and leaders who would shape everything that followed.

The first Academy class graduated in 2191. Twelve officers. Nine are still remembered by name. Three are still alive.

## The Selection: Breaking and Remaking

Longwatch accepts applications from anyone — Federal fleet, colonial militia, civilian specialists, even corporate security (though few of those make it). Bloc origin doesn't matter. What matters is whether you can let go of it.

### The Numbers
- ~2,000 applications per year
- ~400 accepted to the Academy
- ~60 graduate
- 85% washout rate

### Phase One: The Stripping (Months 1-4)

They take everything that makes you *you* and hold it up to the light.

No national flags. No bloc insignia. No native language except in designated "heritage hours." You eat together, sleep in mixed quarters, train in teams deliberately assembled to maximize cultural friction. A Chinese nationalist bunking with a Taiwanese independence advocate. A Brazilian Catholic paired with a Russian atheist. A Martian autonomist working alongside an Earth Federal loyalist.

The instructors watch for cracks. Who retreats into their own group at meals? Who makes comments under their breath? Who's performing tolerance versus living it?

The academic work is brutal — xenolinguistics, first contact theory, advanced astrogation, combat tactics, emergency medicine, engineering fundamentals. You're expected to be competent at everything because out in the dark, specialists are a luxury.

But the academics aren't what breaks people. The psych evaluations do.

Weekly sessions with Longwatch psychologists who have one job: find the loyalties you're hiding from yourself. They're not looking for spies. They're looking for the officer who genuinely believes they've shed their bloc identity but will freeze when they have to give an order that hurts "their people." The one who's intellectually post-national but emotionally still Brazilian, still Chinese, still Martian.

Thirty percent wash out in Phase One. Some quit. Some are cut. Some have breakdowns when they realize how deep the roots go.

### Phase Two: The Crucible (Months 5-12)

Deep space simulation. Eight months on a training vessel in the outer system — real patrols, real emergencies, real isolation.

You don't know which emergencies are drills and which are genuine. You don't know which crew members are fellow candidates and which are evaluators. Your commanding officer might be testing you or might be genuinely incompetent — and you have to figure out how to handle it either way.

Communication with Earth is delayed by hours. Then "malfunctions" extend it to days. Then you're told the relay is down and you're on your own for six weeks.

The simulation breaks unit cohesion to see what emerges. Teams are shuffled. Leaders are removed. Resources become scarce. Medical emergencies happen at the worst moments.

Forty percent of remaining candidates wash out here. The ones who make it aren't the toughest or the smartest. They're the ones who, when everything falls apart, reach for their crewmates instead of their countrymen.

### Phase Three: The Oath (Months 13-18)

The survivors return to Luna. Five months of advanced training, specialization, and preparation for active duty.

On the final day, they gather in Vandenberg Hall — named for the founder, who died in 2214 on a deep patrol. The chamber is simple: black walls, a viewport showing the stars, no flags or emblems except the Longwatch symbol.

The Oath:

*"I am Longwatch.*
*I serve no nation, no bloc, no tribe.*
*I serve no corporation, no ideology, no creed.*
*I carry humanity into the dark,*
*And I will bring it home again.*
*Where I walk, Earth's divisions do not follow.*
*What I find, I hold in trust for all.*
*I am the long watch between the stars.*
*I am Longwatch."*

Every graduate, since 2191, has spoken these words in this room. The walls are lined with small metal plates bearing the names of every officer who completed training. Not organized by class, by rank, or by assignment. Just names, in order of graduation. The dead aren't marked differently from the living.

## Culture and Traditions

### The Symbol

A simple circle containing a single point — representing a star seen from a great distance. No colors (colors carry bloc associations). Worn as a small pin on the collar, replacing bloc and national insignia. When a Longwatch officer dies, their pin is recovered if possible and mounted in Vandenberg Hall.

### Forms of Address

Longwatch uses standard naval ranks but drops the national honorifics that persist in the regular fleet. No "Captain-sir" (Western), no "Comrade Captain" (Sino-Russian). Just rank and name, or rank alone.

Among themselves, Longwatch personnel often use "cousin" informally — a deliberate rejection of the "brother/sister" language that carries national and cultural weight. We're not family. We're something we chose.

### The Three Silences

Longwatch tradition holds three topics that are never discussed in operational settings:

1. Where you're from (bloc, nation, city)
2. Who you voted for (Earth politics)
3. What god you pray to (or don't)

Not forbidden — you won't be punished. But speaking of them in duty settings marks you as someone who hasn't fully committed. Off-duty, in private quarters, you can be whatever you were. On the bridge, you're Longwatch.

### Heritage Hours

Four hours per week, optional, where personnel can speak native languages, observe cultural practices, and connect with their origins. This isn't suppression — Longwatch doesn't pretend the past doesn't exist. The point is *compartmentalization*. You can be proud of where you came from and still set it aside when the mission requires.

Some officers never attend heritage hours. Others attend religiously. Neither is considered better.

### The Long Table

Every Longwatch vessel has a single mess table where all ranks eat together. Captain next to ensign, engineer next to xenolinguist. No officers' mess, no enlisted mess. You eat with your crew.

When a crew member dies, their seat is left empty for one meal, then filled. Life continues. The watch goes on.

### The Return Tradition

When a Longwatch vessel returns from deep patrol, the crew doesn't disembark immediately. They gather on the bridge, in view of the sun, and observe one minute of silence for everyone who's ever gone out and not come back. Then they go home.

## Operations: Thirty-Six Years of the Watch

### What Has Longwatch Been Doing?

From 2190 to 2226, Longwatch has been:

**Mapping the outer system:** Jupiter's minor moons. Saturn's ring settlements (before they went dark). The approaches to Uranus and Neptune. Not colonization — reconnaissance. Understanding what's out there.

**First response on the frontier:** When a station goes silent, when a ship sends a distress call from beyond Jupiter, when something happens too far away for the regular fleet to respond in time — Longwatch goes. They've found derelict ships with crews dead from life support failure. They've evacuated burning stations. They've faced down pirate flotillas and talked their way out when guns would have meant mutual destruction.

**The Saturn Withdrawal:** When Federal presence collapsed at Saturn in the 2180s, Longwatch was the last to leave. Some argue they shouldn't have left at all. But twelve ships can't hold territory — they can only watch it. Longwatch still makes Saturn patrols. Not to enforce Federal law (there isn't any out there), but to observe. To keep the maps current. To remind the fringes that someone's watching.

**Contact protocols:** Thirty-six years of false alarms. An anomalous signal that turned out to be a malfunctioning relay. A structure on a Jovian moon that looked artificial until they got close enough to see it was geological. A derelict that seemed alien until they boarded and found human corpses from a colony ship that went missing in 2089. Longwatch has trained for first contact since its founding. They've never made it. Until now.

### Famous Missions

**The Callisto Rescue (2198):** A research station lost containment during an outbreak of modified bacteria. Two hundred researchers, families, support staff. The regular fleet quarantined the station — standard protocol, protect the larger population. Longwatch Captain Yuki Tanaka took her ship *Ibn Battuta* in anyway, established a field hospital in a cargo bay, and worked with the station's doctors to contain the outbreak. Seventy-three dead. A hundred and twenty-seven saved. Tanaka was censured by Fleet Command and decorated by the Council. She later became Longwatch Commander (2208-2221).

**The Silent Year (2211):** The same year as the FTL breakthrough. Longwatch vessel *Amundsen* departed for a survey of trans-Neptunian objects. Scheduled three-month mission. They went silent after six weeks. For eleven months, nothing. Fleet Command declared them lost. Then they came back. The *Amundsen* emerged from the dark with a damaged communications array, half their fuel gone, and data cores full of observations from further out than any human vessel had traveled. What they found has never been fully declassified. Longwatch says "nothing of note — ice, rock, void." But the *Amundsen* crew were all promoted, all reassigned to Luna-based positions, and all declined interviews for the rest of their careers. Probably coincidence. Probably just burnout from a hard mission that went wrong. Probably.

**The Titan Standoff (2219):** Han-Lockheed's New Shanghai had been tolerating Longwatch patrols — they had nothing to hide that Longwatch could prove. But when Commander Park's vessel *Shackleton* detected an unregistered ship burning hard for interstellar space, they moved to intercept. Han-Lockheed security vessels moved to block them. Three corporate cruisers against one Longwatch explorer. Park held position for six hours, broadcasting demands for the fleeing ship to halt. The unregistered vessel escaped. But Park had recorded everything — the corporate fleet's interference, the trajectory of the fleeing ship, all of it. The data went to the Council. Nothing happened publicly. But Han-Lockheed's security division had a major leadership change three months later, and corporate vessels have given Longwatch a wider berth since.

## Relationship with Others

### The Regular Fleet

Complicated. Longwatch is everything the regular fleet is supposed to be but isn't. That breeds respect and resentment in equal measure.

Fleet officers call Longwatch "the monks" — half-admiring, half-mocking. The implication: they've given up normal life for an ideal that doesn't exist. You can't really shed your origins. You can only pretend.

Longwatch officers don't argue the point. They don't need to.

Transfers from regular fleet to Longwatch are rare but happen. Transfers the other direction are almost unheard of. Once you've been Longwatch, going back to bloc politics feels like putting on dirty clothes.

### Bloc Governments

Publicly supportive. The Federal Council created Longwatch; the blocs can't oppose it openly.

Privately? Mixed. Some see Longwatch as proof that post-national identity is possible — a model for humanity's future. Others see it as a rebuke, an implicit accusation that bloc loyalty is primitive. Still others want their own people in Longwatch, treating it as another arena for competition despite its explicit rejection of such thinking.

The Western Alliance has tried three times to establish "officer exchange programs" that would embed bloc-selected personnel in Longwatch. The Council has refused each time. Longwatch selects its own.

### Corporations

Corporations *hate* Longwatch.

Regular Federal fleet can be influenced. Budget allocations, procurement contracts, political pressure — there are levers. Officers have career ambitions, families, retirement plans. They can be reasoned with.

Longwatch can't. They don't care about promotions. They don't need corporate contracts. They're already at the edge of human space with nothing to threaten them with and nothing to offer them.

When a Longwatch vessel shows up, you can't bribe the captain. You can't go over their head to a friendly admiral. You can't wait them out — they're used to waiting. All you can do is hope your paperwork is clean.

Han-Lockheed officially "respects Longwatch's vital mission." Unofficially, they've spent thirty years trying to get someone — anyone — inside. The selection process defeats them every time. You can't fake the kind of person who passes Phase Two.

### Frontier Settlements

To the stations and colonies in the outer system, Longwatch are the closest thing to heroes. Not because they enforce Federal law — often they don't, lacking the numbers and mandate. But because when things go wrong, they come.

A station at Jupiter loses power, Longwatch comes. A ship vanishes at Saturn, Longwatch investigates. A settlement reports pirates, Longwatch shows up and suddenly the pirates are elsewhere.

They can't be everywhere. They can't save everyone. But they try. And they come back. And they remember the names.

## The Signal Mission

When the Signal was detected, there was no debate about who would go. Regular fleet couldn't be trusted — too many bloc interests, too much risk of someone deciding first contact should benefit their people first. Corporate vessels were obviously unacceptable.

It had to be Longwatch. It had to be the *Prometheus* — the only ship that could get there.

And it had to be a captain who embodied everything Longwatch stands for. Someone who could speak for humanity without speaking for Earth, the Alliance, or the Sphere. Someone who could make first contact decisions without calculating political advantage.

They chose you.
