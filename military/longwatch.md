## Mission

3. Scientific research advancing human knowledge

Longwatch ships are explorers, scientists, diplomats, and when necessary, warriors.

## Culture

Longwatch personnel are genuinely post-national. Yes, they come from Earth blocs, but Longwatch identity supersedes everything else. The service attracts idealists, adventurers, scholars—people who believe in expanding human knowledge.

**Longwatch officers are known for:**
- Intellectual curiosity and breadth of knowledge
- Calm under pressure (space doesn't forgive panic)
- Diplomatic skill (might meet aliens, must handle them well)
- Quiet confidence (you don't brag when you're the best)

*The saying: "A Longwatch captain could navigate an asteroid field, translate an alien language, perform emergency surgery, and negotiate a peace treaty—preferably not all in the same day."*

## The Significance of the Prometheus

The *Prometheus* represents something unprecedented:
- First FTL-capable vessel
- Only FTL-capable vessel (until *Magellan* completes in 2027-2028)
- If lost, humanity's FTL capability is gone for years
- One-of-a-kind strategic asset
- Simultaneously flagship and prototype

This mission is:
- First crewed FTL voyage at interstellar distance
- First contact potential
- 3-4 month mission with no communication or support possible
- If something goes wrong, there's no rescue
