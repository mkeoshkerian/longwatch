## The Name

*Prometheus* — the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.

The name carries weight:
- Bringing knowledge/power to humanity (FTL, first contact)
- The hubris angle—stealing fire, suffering for it
- Historic resonance but also ominous
- Sets up potential tragedy without being heavy-handed

The crew knows the mythology. They know how Prometheus's story ended.

## Sister Ship

UEFS *Magellan* (Prometheus-class) is under construction. Won't be ready until 2227-2228.

Until then, *Prometheus* is alone.
