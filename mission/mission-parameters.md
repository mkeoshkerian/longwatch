# Mission Parameters

The official (and unofficial) objectives for your voyage.

---

## Authorization

**Authorized by:** Federal Council (13-2 vote)  
**Commanding Authority:** Longwatch Command, Ganymede  
**Launch Date:** January 15, 2226

---

## Mission Objectives (Priority Order)

### Primary Objective
Locate and analyze signal source. Determine nature—artificial probe, spacecraft, installation, planet-bound civilization.

### Secondary Objective
If intelligence is present, establish communication following First Contact Protocols. Peaceful intent, mutual understanding, knowledge exchange.

### Tertiary Objective
Collect scientific data on interstellar space, potential exoplanets, any phenomena encountered.

### Standing Order
Ensure survival of ship and crew. Do not compromise human safety for contact. Do not reveal Earth's location if threat is detected.

## Mission Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| January 15, 2226 | Launch from Ganymede orbit |
| January 17, 2226 | FTL jump initiation |
| ~February 8-10, 2226 | Arrival at destination (22-23 days transit) |
| February-March 2226 | Investigation phase (~6 weeks estimated) |
| ~March 15, 2226 | Return jump |
| ~April 7, 2226 | Arrival at Ganymede |

**Total mission:** 3-4 months if everything goes perfectly (it won't)

## Communication

**Critical fact:** Once FTL jump occurs, the *Prometheus* will be completely isolated.

- No FTL communication exists
- Quantum entanglement communicators are too unreliable
- Light-speed communication would take 45-50 years each way
- The crew will be utterly alone until return

---

## Rules of Engagement

### If Contact is Made:
- Observe before interaction
- Transmit mathematical greeting (prime numbers, basic arithmetic)
- Wait for response
- Establish basic communication framework
- Share information carefully—avoid revealing Earth's exact location initially
- Assess intentions and compatibility

### Abort Conditions:
- Hostile action detected
- Technology vastly superior to humanity's (potential threat)
- Biological incompatibility detected
- Direct threat to ship or crew

**Standing order:** Captain has absolute authority to break off contact and return to solar system.

---

## Political Compromise

### Crew Composition:
- Representatives from all major blocs (selected for competence, not just politics)
- Corporate observers permitted (5 total, officially scientific specialists)

### Data Sharing:
- Mission data shared with all blocs equally (in theory)
- First contact decisions rest with captain
- Federal Council maintains ultimate authority

---

## What Could Go Wrong

- Drive failure far from any assistance
- Hostile contact
- Signal source is not what anyone expected
- Internal conflict among crew or mission sponsors
- Corporate observers with secondary objectives
- Something follows you back
- The unknown—this has never been done before

---

## Resources

- Your ship and crew (~180 personnel)
- 5 years of independent operational supplies
- 4 short-range shuttles, 2 long-range explorer craft
- Advanced scientific facilities
- Manufacturing capability (3D printing, machine shop)
- Your judgment
