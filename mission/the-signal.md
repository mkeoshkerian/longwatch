# The Signal

The reason for everything.

## Discovery

[TBD: Fill in details]
- **When detected:** [Recently—weeks? months? a year ago?]
- **Detected by:** [Which array? Who noticed first?]
- **Initial reaction:** [Kept secret? Announced publicly? Leaked?]

## Characteristics

What we know:
- **Clearly artificial:** Not natural phenomena. Mathematical structure, patterns that don't occur in nature.
- **Origin:** Interstellar space. [TBD: How far? Which direction? Specific star system?]
- **Content:** [TBD: What does it contain?]
  - Mathematical sequences?
  - Encoded information?
  - A simple repeating beacon?
  - Something more complex?

## Why FTL Is the Only Option

- The Signal originates far enough away that sublight travel would take hundreds of years
- Even at best-case interplanetary speeds, a probe would arrive long after everyone who sent it is dead
- FTL makes investigation possible within a human lifetime
- But FTL ships are rare and valuable—this is a major commitment

## Open Questions

The mission exists to answer these:
- What is sending the Signal?
- Is it still active, or are we detecting ancient echoes?
- Is it a beacon meant to attract attention? A warning? Something else?
- Is anyone—or anything—still there?

## Theories (In-Universe)

[TBD: What do people in the setting think?]
- First contact optimists: Friendly aliens want to meet us
- Pessimists: It's a trap, or a warning to stay away
- Scientists: Reserve judgment until we have data
- Religious groups: [Various interpretations]
- Skeptics: Instrument error, natural phenomena we don't understand yet
