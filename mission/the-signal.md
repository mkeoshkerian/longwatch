# The Signal

The reason for everything.

## Discovery

**Date:** September 15, 2225  
**Detection:** Deep Space Monitoring Array Epsilon-7 (located in outer Belt)  
**Initial Classification:** Unknown artificial signal

At 0342 UTC, automated systems detected anomalous radio emission from beyond solar system. Initial assumption: equipment malfunction. But cross-check with other arrays confirmed it. The signal was real, external, and artificial.

## Signal Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Origin | ~45-50 light-years distant |
| Direction | Roughly toward Tau Ceti (but offset 15 degrees—NOT from Tau Ceti itself) |
| Frequency | 1420 MHz (hydrogen line—universal beacon frequency) |
| Pattern | Repeating mathematical sequence: primes, then increasingly complex concepts |
| Nature | Directed transmission—we're detecting spillover, not a beacon aimed at us |
| Duration | Continuous since detection |

**Key insight:** The signal isn't meant for us—we're eavesdropping. Like radio waves that leaked past Earth into space during our broadcast era. We're catching spillover from a targeted transmission.

## Analysis and Debate (September-December 2225)

### Scientific Community:
- Immediate excitement—first evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence
- Demands for careful analysis before response
- Concerns about contamination of data

### Federal Government:
- Security concerns—unknown technology, unknown intentions
- Political considerations—which bloc claims credit/control
- Resource allocation—FTL mission is enormously expensive

### Public Reaction:
- Initial skepticism (hoax accusations)
- Religious responses ranging from apocalyptic to welcoming
- Demands for transparency vs. security classification

### Corporate Interests:
- Potential commercial applications of alien technology
- Offers to fund/participate in mission
- Concerns about Federal monopoly on contact

## The Decision

After three months of analysis, Federal Council voted 13-2 to authorize mission.

**Launch Date:** January 15, 2226

## What the Signal Proves

- We are not alone
- Someone is out there, transmitting
- They use mathematics and the hydrogen line (universal concepts)
- They have technology at least comparable to ours

## What We Don't Know

- What is sending it? (Probe? Ship? Installation? Planet-bound civilization?)
- Is the source still active, or are we detecting ancient echoes?
- Is it a beacon? A warning? Routine communication we're intercepting?
- Do they know we exist?
- Do they know we're coming?
