# The Signal - A Sci-Fi Roleplaying World

A near-future hard sci-fi setting for narrative roleplaying. You are the captain of one of humanity's few FTL-capable ships, sent to investigate an artificial signal from interstellar space.

## How to Use This

These docs are the "world bible" for the campaign. When playing:

1. Load the relevant docs into context (Claude Code makes this easy)
2. Play the narrative
3. Edit docs directly when you want to change or expand the world
4. Keep session logs in `/sessions` if you want a record

## Quick Setting Summary

- **When:** ~200 years from now
- **Where:** Humanity has colonized the solar system; beyond Jupiter is frontier; interstellar is unknown
- **Tech Level:** Hard sci-fi with one exception—FTL exists but is rare, expensive, and requires massive infrastructure
- **Tone:** Exploration, mystery, political tension between Earth, corps, and frontier

## What's Established vs. TBD

Check individual docs for `[TBD]` markers—these are things we haven't nailed down yet and can be decided during play or worldbuilding sessions.
