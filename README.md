# The Longwatch Chronicles: Worldbuilding Bible

A near-future hard sci-fi setting for narrative roleplaying. You are Captain of the UEFS *Prometheus*, humanity's first and only FTL-capable vessel, sent to investigate an artificial signal from interstellar space.

## Setting Overview

- **Year:** 2225-2226 CE
- **Era:** The Federal Century
- **Humanity's Reach:** Inner Solar System (established), Jupiter System (frontier), Beyond Jupiter (lawless)
- **Major Development:** First crewed FTL mission preparing to launch

The year is 2225, and humanity stands at a threshold. Two centuries of expansion have transformed us from a single-planet species into a sprawling interplanetary civilization. Earth's nations have reorganized into powerful regional blocs united under a Federal Space Government. The Moon hosts over 60 million people. Mars is being terraformed. The asteroid belt churns with mining operations.

Three months ago, deep space monitoring stations detected it: an artificial signal originating from approximately 45-50 light-years distant. The pattern is unmistakable—mathematical, clearly intelligent. It is not a message meant for us; we're detecting spillover from a targeted transmission. But it is real, and it is waiting.

Humanity's response: the UEFS *Prometheus*, a Prometheus-class deep space explorer—humanity's first and only FTL-capable vessel—will make the first crewed faster-than-light jump in human history.

You are her captain.
