## Corporate Observers

Five corporate representatives are aboard, officially as scientific specialists. In reality:
- They represent corporate interests
- Some may have secondary objectives
- At least one is probably gathering intelligence on FTL technology
- They have legitimate scientific credentials (Longwatch wouldn't accept otherwise)
- But their loyalties are... complicated

**Consider:** Which corporations sent them? What are their real orders?

## Crew Culture

Longwatch crews are:
- Post-national (Longwatch identity supersedes bloc origin)
- Highly competent (85% washout rate in training)
- Diverse (representatives from all blocs, selected for merit)
- Idealistic (they believe in the mission)
- Pragmatic (space doesn't forgive mistakes)

But 180 people on a 3-4 month mission with no contact home, facing the unknown... tensions will emerge.
