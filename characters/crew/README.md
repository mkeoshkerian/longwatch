## Corporate Observers

5 corporate observers are aboard, distributed across major corps as political compromise. The corporations are rivals—Han-Lockheed, Ceres-Pallas, and others aren't coordinating, they're competing. Their observers may be watching each other as much as the FTL drive.

**The realistic breakdown:**
- 1-2 are genuine scientists who happen to work for corps. No secret orders. Just doing their job.
- 1-2 have mild secondary objectives. "Report what you learn about FTL, don't take risks." Passive intelligence gathering.
- 1 is the real threat. Active espionage mission. Willing to do something about it.

The Captain knows there are 5 corporate observers. Longwatch vetted them, they have real credentials. But everyone assumes at least one has secondary objectives. You don't know which—or how far they'll go.

**The specific identities of these 5 observers are TBD.**

## Crew Culture

Longwatch crews are:
- Post-national (Longwatch identity supersedes bloc origin)
- Highly competent (85% washout rate in training)
- Diverse (representatives from all blocs, selected for merit)
- Idealistic (they believe in the mission)
- Pragmatic (space doesn't forgive mistakes)

But 180 people on a 3-4 month mission with no contact home, facing the unknown... tensions will emerge.
