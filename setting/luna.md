# Luna (Earth's Moon)

**Population:** 62 million  
**Status:** Federal administered, Earth bloc territories  
**Gravity:** 0.165g  
**Economy:** Manufacturing, services, gateway operations

Luna is humanity's second home, the most developed extraterrestrial body, and the bridge between Earth and deep space. After 150 years of continuous habitation, it feels less like a frontier and more like an unusual Earth city.

## Major Settlements

### New Armstrong (American sector)
**Population:** 12 million

Focused on aerospace manufacturing and corporate HQ functions. Shea Crater has been pressurized and houses the financial district—stock exchanges, corporate headquarters, legal offices. Above ground, the Armstrong Dome covers 40 square kilometers with Earth-normal pressure and 0.5g spin-gravity rings for long-term residents.

### Tsiolkovsky (Sino-Russian sector)
**Population:** 8 million

Heavy industry and manufacturing. The crater is honeycombed with factories producing everything from hull plating to electronics. Less luxurious than Western settlements but ruthlessly efficient.

### Europa Station (Pan-European sector)
**Population:** 6 million

High-tech research and precision manufacturing. The Europeans built up rather than down—soaring towers in minimal Lunar gravity, connected by transparent tubes, emphasizing aesthetic beauty alongside function.

### Gateway L5
**Population:** 200,000

Not on Luna but nearby—the Earth-Luna L5 station. Enormous facility, solar arrays kilometers across, maintenance crews of thousands. Critical logistics hub for system-wide operations.

## Culture and Society

Lunars are post-national in a way no other population is. Yes, settlements have bloc affiliations, but after three or four generations, people identify as Lunar first. The low gravity, shared infrastructure, constant presence of Earth in the sky—it creates distinct identity.

**Lunars are known for:**
- **Practicality:** No tolerance for bullshit; everything is life-support critical
- **Consensus-building:** Can't afford conflict when sharing air recyclers
- **Pride:** See themselves as humanity's vanguard, slightly superior to Earth-bound populations
- **Physical distinctiveness:** Generations in low-g created taller, more graceful builds; Lunars struggle in Earth gravity

Political tensions that matter on Earth barely register on Luna. What matters: does the water recycler work, is the radiation shielding adequate, is the latest batch of crops healthy?

## Economy

Luna's economy is built on:
- **Component manufacturing:** Low gravity and vacuum enable processes impossible on Earth
- **Gateway services:** Everything headed to deep space passes through Luna
- **Financial services:** Major banks and exchanges operate from Shea Crater
- **Tourism:** Earth's wealthy visit to experience low-g luxury
