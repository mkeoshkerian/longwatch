# The Asteroid Belt

The industrial engine of human civilization. Raw materials flow inward from here to feed Earth, Mars, and the Moon.

## Character

- "Full of mining colonies and stations of all sizes"
- Ranges from major corporate stations to one-family rock-hopper operations
- Rough, practical, working-class culture
- Communication delay to Earth: ~15-25 minutes depending on orbital positions

## Governance

[TBD: How is the Belt governed?]
- Earth federal authority extends here, but enforcement is spotty?
- Megacorps effectively run their own stations?
- Belter unions or independent associations?
- Tension between Earth regulations and Belt realities?

## Economy

- Mining: metals, water ice, rare elements
- Manufacturing: easier to build big things in microgravity
- Shipyards? Some of humanity's ships may be Belt-built

## Key Locations

[TBD: Name some stations, settlements, or notable asteroids]
- Ceres - largest body, probably a major hub
- Vesta?
- Corporate stations vs. independent settlements

## Belter Culture

[TBD: What makes Belters distinct?]
- Practical, resourceful, self-reliant
- View of Earth as distant, bureaucratic, extractive?
- Distinct accents, slang, traditions?
- Multi-generational Belters who've never been to a planet?
