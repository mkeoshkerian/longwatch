# Jupiter System - The Frontier

**Population:** ~320,000  
**Status:** Federal jurisdiction (barely), frontier  
**Gravity:** Varies by moon  
**Economy:** Research, ice mining, helium-3 extraction

Jupiter represents humanity's current frontier—the furthest we've established permanent, legitimate presence. It's also where Federal authority starts to fray.

## Major Locations

### Ganymede Station
**Population:** 180,000

The system hub. Combination research base, mining operations center, and Federal military outpost. This is the jumping-off point for deep space—and where the FTL breakthrough occurred.

**Culture:** Frontier pragmatism mixed with scientific ambition. People come here to push boundaries—scientific, commercial, personal.

**Note:** Dr. Okonkwo's team made the FTL breakthrough here in 2223 at Ganymede Research Station.

### Europa Research Complex
**Population:** 25,000

Entirely devoted to studying the subsurface ocean beneath Europa's ice. Potential for life beneath that ice makes Europa humanity's most exciting astrobiological target.

The base is pristine, heavily regulated—no contamination of Europa's ocean permitted.

### Callisto Operations
**Population:** 45,000

Heavy ice mining and He-3 extraction. Less radiation than Ganymede or Europa (Jupiter's magnetic field is brutal), so serves as industrial center. Corporate dominated.

### Io
**Population:** 200 (permanent staff only)

All automated operation management. Io's volcanic activity and radiation make long-term habitation nearly impossible, but sulfur and rare earth mining is lucrative enough to justify robotic operations.

### The Galilean Shipyards

Orbital construction facilities between Ganymede and Callisto. This is where deep space vessels are built—too expensive to lift from Earth, easier to construct in microgravity from Belt materials.

## Frontier Culture

Jovians are a different breed:

- **Risk Acceptance:** You don't come to Jupiter for safety; radiation, distance, danger are constant
- **Scientific Drive:** Huge proportion of population is researchers, engineers, explorers
- **Corporate-Federal Tension:** Companies want to exploit resources; Federal wants to preserve and study
- **Independence:** Like Belters but more educated; Jovians resent Earth authority

## The Strategic Calculus

Jupiter matters enormously:

- **He-3 Mining:** Essential fuel for fusion reactors, only source is gas giant atmospheres
- **Europa:** If life exists there, it changes everything about humanity's place in universe
- **Forward Base:** Military staging ground
- **FTL Origin:** The breakthrough happened here—Ganymede Research Station is now heavily secured

But it's brutally expensive to maintain presence this far out. Jupiter is subsidized by Earth—corporations pay licensing fees, but Federal military/research presence runs at massive deficit.
