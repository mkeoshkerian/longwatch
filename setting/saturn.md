# Saturn and Beyond - The Wild West

**Population:** Unknown (estimated 50,000-100,000, possibly more)  
**Status:** Effectively lawless  
**Gravity:** Varies by moon  
**Economy:** Illegal mining, piracy, fringe settlements, corporate wildcatting

Beyond Jupiter, Federal authority is theoretical. Sure, officially Saturn is Federal jurisdiction. In practice, it's ungoverned space.

## Why the Lawlessness?

Distance, expense, and politics:

- **Cost:** Maintaining military/police presence at Saturn is hideously expensive
- **Economic Priority:** Saturn's resources aren't valuable enough to justify enforcement
- **Political Will:** Earth blocs won't fund large-scale Saturn operations; too many domestic priorities
- **Corporate Lobbying:** Some megacorps actually prefer minimal Federal presence

**Result:** Saturn is where you go when you don't want to be found.

## Titan: New Shanghai

**Population:** 30,000-40,000

The only settlement approaching legitimacy. A corporate city-state run by Han-Lockheed Orbital, ostensibly mining hydrocarbons from Titan's lakes and atmosphere.

In reality, New Shanghai is:
- **Corporate Fiefdom:** Han-Lockheed makes the rules, employs everyone, owns everything
- **Money Laundering Hub:** Questionable fortunes get cleaned here
- **Black Market:** Illegal tech, restricted materials, contraband—if you want it, New Shanghai has it
- **Refuge:** Political dissidents, corporate criminals, people fleeing Belt justice

Federal Government pretends New Shanghai follows Federal law. Han-Lockheed pretends to care. Everyone knows it's fiction.

## The Ring Settlements

Saturn's rings contain dozens of small operations—10 to 500 people each. Some are mining ice and minerals. Some are religious communities. Some are criminal hideouts. Some are just crazy prospectors.

**Notable examples:**

- **The Cassini Collective:** 200 anarchist settlers, produce remarkable art and philosophy, occasionally piracy
- **Enceladus Mission:** 80 legitimate researchers studying potential subsurface ocean, funded by European interests, constantly harassed by pirates
- **Iapetus Station:** 150 smugglers, arms dealers, information brokers; the criminal nexus

## Dangers

Saturn space is genuinely dangerous:

- **Pirates:** Well-armed, ruthless, prey on isolated ships
- **Corporate Mercenaries:** Private military contractors enforcing corporate interests violently
- **Cultists:** Fringe religious groups, some benign, some actively hostile to outsiders
- **Malfunctioning Systems:** Old tech, minimal maintenance, things break and kill people
- **No Rescue:** If something goes wrong, you're on your own; Federal ships won't come

*The joke: "In the Belt, law is what you can enforce. At Jupiter, law is what Federal says it is. At Saturn, law is dead."*

## Uranus, Neptune, and Beyond

Almost nothing permanent. A few corporate survey missions to Uranus's moons (methane, ammonia). Rumored Neptune research outpost, unconfirmed. Trans-Neptunian objects unexplored except for flyby probes.

Kuiper Belt and beyond: true unknown. No permanent human presence, no infrastructure, just robots and mysteries.
