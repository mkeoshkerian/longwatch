# Inner System

The settled, "civilized" part of human space. Communication with Earth is measured in minutes, not hours.

## The Moon

- Large, established colony
- Essentially Earth's backyard
- [TBD: Population? Governance structure? Key settlements?]
- Likely where early space industry developed
- A jump gate here? Or Earth-Moon L5?

## Mars

- Fully colonized—humanity's second home
- [TBD: How independent is Mars politically?]
- Possible tensions with Earth over autonomy
- Terraforming efforts? Or domed cities?
- [TBD: Key cities, culture, relationship to the mission]

## Venus

- Orbital stations only (surface is hellish)
- Scientific outposts, atmospheric research
- Smaller population than Moon or Mars
- [TBD: Any strategic importance? Cloud cities?]

## Inner System Culture

[TBD: What distinguishes "inner system" people from Belters or frontier folk?]
- More connected to Earth
- More bureaucratic, more "civilized"
- View the outer system as rough, dangerous
