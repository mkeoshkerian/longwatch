# Earth

## Political Structure

Earth is organized into a **federal system** with a relatively strong central authority. However, this isn't a unified world government—power blocs still exist and matter.

### The Federal Government

- [TBD: Name - "United Earth," "Earth Collective," "Terran Federation"?]
- Has authority over interplanetary affairs, military, major scientific initiatives
- Controls the FTL program (or at least regulates it heavily)
- Strong enough to push back against megacorps, but must negotiate

### Power Blocs

[TBD: What are the major blocs? Some possibilities:]
- Regional federations (North American Union, European Federation, Asian Cooperative, etc.)
- Ideological divisions?
- Old nation-states still exist but matter less?

## Relationship with Megacorps

The federal government and megacorps exist in tension:
- Corps are "major players and pivotal"
- They're not quite nation-states, but close
- Some corps may have their own FTL-capable ships
- Government needs corp resources; corps need government legitimacy

## Earth's Role in the Mission

[TBD: Key questions]
- Is this mission government-run, corp-funded, or joint?
- What political factions supported or opposed it?
- What does Earth hope to gain from first contact?
