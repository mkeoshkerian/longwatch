# Earth and the Political Blocs

Humanity in 2225 is organized into five major power blocs plus several aligned democratic states. Earth governance remains national/regional, with the Federal Space Government handling extraterrestrial affairs.

## The Sino-Russian Sphere

**Structure:** Oligarchic authoritarianism with strong state direction  
**Capital:** Beijing (political), Shanghai (economic)  
**Population:** ~2.8 billion  
**Philosophy:** State-managed capitalism, technocratic governance, social control

Emerged from fusion of Chinese and Russian interests in the 2030s-2040s. Following Russia's turbulent transition from the Putin era, a new oligarchic system developed with strong Chinese influence. Not direct Chinese control—Russian pride wouldn't permit that—but deep economic and political integration.

**Characteristics:**
- **Technocratic Efficiency:** Major infrastructure projects, five-year plans that work, massive state investment
- **Social Control:** Sophisticated surveillance, social credit systems, limited political freedom
- **Industrial Might:** Dominates heavy manufacturing, resource extraction, brute-force engineering
- **Long-term Planning:** Thinks in decades and centuries, not election cycles

**In Space:** Controls significant Belt mining operations (Ceres-Pallas Consortium has heavy Chinese backing), major Lunar settlements (Tsiolkovsky Crater hosts 8 million), substantial Mars presence (Zhurong Base, 4 million).

## Pan-European Federation

**Structure:** Parliamentary democracy with strong federalist framework  
**Capital:** Brussels (administrative), Strasbourg (parliament)  
**Population:** ~980 million  
**Philosophy:** Social democracy, environmental stewardship, precision engineering, regulatory governance

Expanded gradually from the EU core, eventually incorporating most of geographic Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East.

**Characteristics:**
- **Design Excellence:** World leaders in precision engineering, sustainable technology, aesthetic integration
- **Regulatory Framework:** Complex but comprehensive legal systems, emphasis on safety
- **Social Welfare:** Strong safety nets, education investment, worker protections
- **Multilateral Diplomacy:** Preference for negotiation over unilateral action

**In Space:** Dominates Venus orbital operations (Cytherean Consortium is 70% European capital), contributes significantly to Mars terraforming technology (AtmoTech is German-French), substantial Lunar presence in high-tech manufacturing.

## Western Hemisphere Alliance

**Structure:** Federal democratic system, capitalist with mercantilist tendencies  
**Capital:** Washington D.C. (administrative), São Paulo (economic co-center)  
**Population:** ~1.9 billion  
**Philosophy:** Market capitalism, hemispheric integration, pragmatic interventionism

Grew from NAFTA/USMCA, expanding to encompass North and South America. The U.S. remains first among equals, but Brazilian, Mexican, Argentine, and Canadian voices carry real weight. True bilingualism (English/Spanish) is the norm.

**Characteristics:**
- **Economic Dynamism:** Largest combined economy, entrepreneurial culture
- **Technological Innovation:** Leading in AI, biotech, consumer technology
- **Military Capability:** Most powerful conventional forces (now under Federal Space authority)
- **Pragmatic Capitalism:** Embraces markets but willing to intervene for strategic goals

**In Space:** Dominates Mars development (over half of Martian population in Alliance-backed settlements), controls major corporate HQs, maintains largest Lunar population concentration.

## African Union

**Structure:** Continental federation with strong regional autonomy  
**Capital:** Addis Ababa  
**Population:** ~3.2 billion  
**Philosophy:** Pan-Africanism, sustainable development

The African Union is the weakest of the major factions but still a significant player due to demographic advantages—youngest population, growing educated workforce.

**Characteristics:**
- **Demographic Advantage:** Youngest population, innovation potential
- **Growing Influence:** Rising power, not yet dominant
- **Space Launch Advantage:** Equatorial locations ideal for launches

**In Space:** Smallest presence among major blocs but growing. Research presence on Luna and Mars. Often serves as swing vote in Federal Council decisions—important politically if not a powerhouse.

## Aligned Democratic States

Not a formal bloc but a coalition: Japan, Australia, unified Korea, New Zealand, several Southeast Asian democracies. Coordinate closely with Western Alliance and Pan-European Federation while maintaining sovereignty.

**Korea Unification (2089):** Following collapse of North Korean regime and careful 15-year integration, Korea unified under federal democratic system. Now a major technological and economic power.

**Japan:** Strong industrial base despite demographic challenges, leaders in robotics and automation.

**Australia:** Resource wealthy, Pacific anchor for aligned democracies.
