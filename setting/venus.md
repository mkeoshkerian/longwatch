# Venus

**Population:** 180,000 (orbital only)  
**Status:** Federal administered, Pan-European dominated  
**Gravity:** 0.90g (surface), microgravity (stations)  
**Economy:** Atmospheric mining, research, prestige operations

Venus is hell. Surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, atmospheric pressure that would crush submarines, clouds of sulfuric acid. It is also humanity's greatest engineering achievement.

## Orbital Infrastructure

Thirty-seven major orbital stations ring Venus at various altitudes:

### Cytherean Prime
**Population:** 45,000

The largest station, parked at stable L1. Combination research institute, mining operations center, and zero-g manufacturing complex. European design—elegant, modular, beautiful in its functionality.

### Ishtar Station
**Population:** 18,000

Focused on atmospheric science and cloud-layer research. Maintains aerostats that descend into Venus's atmosphere at the 50km altitude where pressure and temperature are almost Earth-like.

### Aphrodite Complex
**Population:** 12,000

Corporate mining operation extracting carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds, and trace elements from upper atmosphere for use across the system.

Plus numerous smaller stations, research outposts, and industrial facilities.

## Why Venus?

Several reasons justify the enormous expense:

- **Atmospheric Mining:** Venus's thick atmosphere contains valuable industrial feedstock—carbon dioxide for terraforming Mars, sulfuric acid precursors, rare compounds
- **Research:** Understanding Venus's runaway greenhouse informs climate management on Earth and Mars. Cloud-layer extremophile bacteria discovered in 2156 revolutionized astrobiology
- **Prestige:** Operating at Venus signals technical capability. Pan-European Federation funds Venus operations partly for the statement it makes
- **Long-term Terraforming:** Some visionaries believe Venus could eventually be terraformed—sunshades, atmospheric stripping, orbital construction. Millennia away, but Mars was once equally impossible

## Venusian Culture

Venusians are elite—must be to survive the environment. High skill requirements, small population, constant danger create intense esprit de corps.

**Characteristics:**
- **Technical Excellence:** Zero tolerance for error; systems must be perfect
- **Aesthetic Sensibility:** European influence shows in station design—form and function integrated
- **Isolation:** Six-month minimum tours, communication lag, creates inward-looking community
- **Arrogance:** Venusians know they're the best engineers in the system and aren't shy about it

*The joke: "Lunars think they're better than Earth. Martians think they're different from Earth. Venusians know they're superior to everyone."*
