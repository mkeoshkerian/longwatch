# Interstellar Space

The great unknown. Humanity has never sent a crewed mission beyond the solar system—until now.

## What We Know

Almost nothing. 

- A handful of unmanned probes launched decades ago, most still in transit
- Voyager-era probes are out there somewhere, long silent
- Telescope observations of nearby star systems
- The Signal

## The Signal

This is why you're here. See [/mission/the-signal.md](/mission/the-signal.md) for details.

Key facts:
- Clearly artificial
- Origin: interstellar space [TBD: how far? which direction?]
- Detected recently enough that FTL is the only practical response
- Important enough to justify sending one of humanity's few FTL ships

## Nearest Stars

Depending on where the Signal originates:

| Star | Distance | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Proxima Centauri | 4.24 ly | Closest star, red dwarf, has planets |
| Alpha Centauri A/B | 4.37 ly | Binary system, sun-like stars |
| Barnard's Star | 5.96 ly | Red dwarf, old, has planets |
| Wolf 359 | 7.86 ly | Red dwarf, faint |
| Sirius | 8.6 ly | Brightest star in sky, binary |

## The Big Questions

- Is the Signal a beacon? A warning? An accident?
- Who or what sent it?
- Are they still there?
- Do they know we're coming?
