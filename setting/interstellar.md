# Interstellar Space

The great unknown. Humanity has never sent a crewed mission beyond the solar system—until now.

## What We Know

Almost nothing.

- A handful of unmanned probes launched decades ago, most still in transit
- Voyager-era probes are out there somewhere, long silent
- Telescope observations of nearby star systems
- **The Signal**

---

## The Signal

This is why you're here. See [the-signal.md](../mission/the-signal.md) for full details.

**Key facts:**
- **Origin:** Approximately 45-50 light-years distant, direction roughly toward Tau Ceti system (but offset by 15 degrees—not from Tau Ceti itself)
- **Nature:** Clearly artificial, mathematical sequences
- **Detection:** September 2225, Deep Space Monitoring Array Epsilon-7
- **Interpretation:** Not meant for us—we're detecting spillover from a directed transmission, like eavesdropping

## Nearest Stars (For Reference)

| Star | Distance | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Proxima Centauri | 4.24 ly | Closest star, red dwarf, has planets |
| Alpha Centauri A/B | 4.37 ly | Binary system, sun-like stars |
| Barnard's Star | 5.96 ly | Red dwarf, old, has planets |
| Tau Ceti | 11.9 ly | Sun-like, multiple planets |
| Signal source | ~45-50 ly | Unknown |

The Signal is NOT from a nearby star. At 45-50 light-years, you're going deep into interstellar space—far beyond anything humanity has ever attempted.

## The Big Questions

The mission exists to answer these:

- What is sending the Signal?
- Is it still active, or are we detecting ancient echoes?
- Is it a beacon meant to attract attention? A warning? Something else?
- Is anyone—or anything—still there?
- Do they know we're coming?

## Theories (In-Universe)

What do people in the setting think?

- **First contact optimists:** Friendly aliens want to meet us
- **Pessimists:** It's a trap, or a warning to stay away
- **Scientists:** Reserve judgment until we have data
- **Religious groups:** Various interpretations ranging from apocalyptic to welcoming
- **Skeptics:** Instrument error, natural phenomena we don't understand yet (largely discredited by analysis)
