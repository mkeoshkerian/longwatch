# The Outer System

## Jupiter - The Frontier

Jupiter is where civilization starts to thin out. Beyond here, you're on your own.

### Character

- "The frontier"—science stations, mining operations
- Communication delay to Earth: 35-50 minutes
- Attracts pioneers, researchers, people who want distance from authority
- Dangerous: radiation, distance from help, harsh conditions

### What's There

- **Moons:** Ganymede, Europa, Callisto, Io—each with different potential
  - Europa: subsurface ocean, astrobiology interest
  - Ganymede: largest moon, possible settlement hub
  - Io: volcanic hellscape, but mineral-rich?
  - Callisto: far enough from Jupiter's radiation to be more habitable
- **Stations:** Science outposts, mining platforms, maybe a jump gate near Ganymede?
- **Atmosphere mining:** Harvesting helium-3 and other gases from Jupiter itself?

### Governance

- Earth's authority is nominal at best
- Corps may have more practical control
- Frontier justice? Station councils?

## Beyond Jupiter

"Totally wild."

- Saturn, Uranus, Neptune—barely touched
- Maybe some automated mining, a few research probes
- No permanent human presence?
- The edge of the map
- Your mission takes you past all of this, into interstellar space
