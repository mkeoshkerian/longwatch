# Mars

**Population:** 47 million  
**Status:** Autonomous governance within Federal framework  
**Gravity:** 0.38g  
**Economy:** Terraforming, research, agriculture (dome-grown), mining

Mars is humanity's grand project and growing headache. Terraforming proceeds ahead of schedule. In another 50-75 years, equatorial valleys might be breathable with assistance. In 150 years, possibly shirt-sleeve conditions.

But Mars isn't waiting for Earth's timeline. A distinct Martian identity is crystallizing, and it wants self-determination.

## Major Settlements

### Mariner Station (Western Alliance origin)
**Population:** 8 million

The first permanent settlement, now a sprawling metropolis carved into Valles Marineris. Original pressure domes supplemented by canyon-spanning structures. Cultural center of Mars—cosmopolitan, proud.

### Zhurong Base (Sino-Russian origin)
**Population:** 5 million

Built in Utopia Planitia, focused on industrial production and agricultural development. More regimented than Mariner but extremely efficient.

### Hellas Basin Collective
**Population:** 4 million

The most "Martian" settlement—minimal Earth bloc identity, cooperative governance, radical terraforming ideology. Pushing for faster atmospheric release over European objections about environmental monitoring.

### Olympus City
**Population:** 3 million

Built on the lower slopes of Olympus Mons, European-backed, research focused. Site of the 2137 Incident.

Plus dozens of smaller settlements, research outposts, and isolated communities. Mars is big—surface area equal to Earth's land mass—and filling up.

## Terraforming Status

| Metric | Current | Pre-Terraforming | Earth |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Atmospheric pressure | 250 mb | ~6 mb | 1013 mb |
| Average temperature | -40°C | -60°C | +15°C |
| Oxygen content | 3% | 0.1% | 21% |

**Methods employed:**
- Orbital mirrors focusing sunlight on poles (European tech)
- Controlled industrial emissions to thicken atmosphere
- Bioengineered extremophile bacteria producing oxygen
- Ice asteroid impacts to deliver water (controversial, paused after 2189)

**Timeline:** 2300 for breathable atmosphere at low elevations, 2350 for widespread habitability.

## Martian Identity and Politics

Martians increasingly see themselves as separate from Earth. The experience of living on a transforming world, the shared danger and ambition, creates powerful bonds. Third and fourth-generation Martians have never been to Earth and don't want to.

**Political factions:**
- **Autonomists (25%):** Want full independence, minimal Earth interference
- **Federalists (45%):** Accept Federal authority but demand more autonomy
- **Integrationists (20%):** See Mars as part of larger humanity, support Federal system
- **Radical Terraformers (10%):** Want faster transformation regardless of concerns

**Current compromise:** Mars has internal self-governance—elects own legislature, controls domestic policy, manages terraforming. But Federal authority over trade, military, foreign policy. Unstable equilibrium.
