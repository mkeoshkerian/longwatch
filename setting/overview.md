# Setting Overview & Timeline

## The Consolidation Era (2025-2075)

### 2025-2040: Climate Reckoning
The late 2020s through 2030s saw Earth's climate crisis reach critical points that fundamentally reshaped global politics. Coastal flooding, agricultural collapse, and mass migration created unprecedented pressures. Paradoxically, this catastrophe drove cooperation—the realization that climate change respected no borders forced international coordination previously thought impossible.

### 2041-2055: The Second Space Race
China and a reformed Russia (having overthrown Putin's regime in the late 2030s, only to slide into a different form of oligarchic authoritarianism) launched aggressive Lunar development, establishing permanent settlements at the South Pole. This spurred competitive response from the United States and European powers.

The Moon Treaty of 2047 established basic principles: no territorial sovereignty, resource extraction rights based on first-exploitation, mandatory sharing of life-support technologies. Messy, contradictory, violated regularly—but it held.

### 2056-2075: The Martian Push
First permanent Martian settlement (Mariner Station) established 2052 by American-European-Japanese consortium. By 2060, China-Russia established Zhurong Base. Competition drove rapid expansion. By 2075, Mars had 200,000 permanent residents and basic terraforming had begun.

## The Federal Era (2076-2150)

### 2076: The Luna Accord
Growing tensions over resource rights threatened armed conflict. The Luna Accord, signed aboard Gateway Station at L5, established the Federal Space Government—not a world government, but a supranational authority specifically for extraterrestrial space.

Key provisions:
- All military spacecraft under Federal authority
- Common framework for resource extraction and settlement
- Preservation of Earth bloc sovereignty over terrestrial matters
- Federal jurisdiction begins at 100km altitude

### 2080-2120: The Great Expansion
With political framework established, human civilization exploded outward. The Belt filled with mining operations. Venus orbital stations multiplied. Mars population reached 15 million by 2100. Jupiter became the frontier as fusion power made the outer system accessible.

This era saw the rise of the megacorporations—mining conglomerates, terraforming giants, ship construction monopolies. As operations spread, corporate power grew to rival Earth blocs.

### 2121-2150: The Martian Question
By 2120, Mars was home to 30 million, many third-generation. Distinct Martian identity emerged with growing resistance to Earth governance.

**The Olympus Mons Incident (2137):** Martian civic groups seized control of terraforming infrastructure, demanding independence. Federal forces backed down rather than risk combat. Compromise: Mars gained internal self-governance while remaining within Federal framework. A band-aid on a wound that continues to fester.

## The Modern Era (2151-2225)

### 2151-2180: The Saturn Frontier
As Jupiter stabilized under Federal authority, attention turned to Saturn. What followed was chaos—corporate expeditions, religious separatists, criminal enterprises, dreamers. The Federal Government, stretched thin, largely withdrew from Saturn space.

By 2180, Saturn had become the Wild West—dozens of settlements, zero central authority, violence endemic.

### 2181-2210: The Corporate Tensions
As megacorp power grew, conflicts multiplied. **The Belt War of 2189** (a misnomer—it lasted three weeks) saw private fleets from rival mining companies exchange fire over disputed asteroids. Federal forces intervened, but the message was clear: corporate fleets could challenge Federal authority.

An uneasy equilibrium developed. Corporations ostensibly accept Federal sovereignty; the Federal Government avoids pushing too hard. Cold peace sustained by mutual deterrence and economic interdependence.

### 2211-2223: The FTL Breakthrough

**2223:** Dr. Sarah Okonkwo's team at Ganymede Research Station was working on exotic matter for radiation shielding. An unexpected quantum fluctuation created a microscopic, stable warp bubble for 0.3 seconds.

They barely understand why it worked—can reproduce it but the theory is incomplete.

Federal government immediately classified everything, put the whole team under security, poured unlimited resources into scaling it up.

### 2224: The Prometheus
The UEFS *Prometheus* commissioned—humanity's first and only FTL-capable vessel. Barely tested. A second ship (the *Magellan*) is under construction but won't be ready until 2227-2228.

### September 2225: The Signal
Deep space monitoring arrays detected artificial transmission from approximately 45-50 light-years distant. After three months of debate, Federal Council authorized mission.

### January 15, 2226: Launch
The mission begins.
