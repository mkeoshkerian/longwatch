# Setting Overview

## Timeline

- **Present day:** Early space colonization efforts
- **~100 years from now:** Mars colonized, Moon has major settlements, asteroid mining begins
- **~150 years from now:** Jupiter frontier opens, Belt becomes economically critical
- **~170 years from now:** FTL breakthrough—alcubierre-adjacent drive developed [TBD: exact mechanics]
- **~200 years from now (NOW):** The Signal is detected. Your mission begins.

## The Solar System at a Glance

| Region | Status | Character |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Earth | Federal government, power blocs | Political center, crowded, bureaucratic |
| Moon | Large colony | Earth's backyard, established |
| Mars | Colonized | Second home, growing independence? |
| Venus | Orbital stations | Scientific outposts |
| Belt | Mining colonies, stations | Industrial, rough, economically vital |
| Jupiter | Frontier | Science stations, mining, edge of civilization |
| Beyond | Wild | Unexplored, dangerous, unknown |

## Tone & Themes

- **Exploration:** The unknown is genuinely unknown
- **Politics:** Earth vs. corps vs. frontier interests
- **Scarcity:** FTL is rare; this mission matters
- **First contact?:** The Signal suggests humanity isn't alone
