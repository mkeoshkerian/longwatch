# Session 1 - 2026-01-20

## Summary
The Pathfinder departed from the Ganymede gate, beginning its journey toward the Signal. First day of FTL travel was uneventful, but crew tensions emerged between the corporate liaison and the science team.

## Key Events
- Successful FTL jump from Ganymede gate
- Discovered corporate liaison has secondary orders from [Corp]
- Chief Engineer reported minor fluctuation in drive harmonics

## Decisions Made
- Chose not to confront the liaison yet—gathering more information first
- Authorized extra diagnostics on the drive

## NPCs Encountered
- Dr. Sarah Webb (Science Officer) - concerned about corp interference
- Marcus Chen (Corporate Liaison) - evasive when questioned

## Open Threads
- What are the liaison's real orders?
- Is the drive fluctuation serious?

## Notes
Good opening session. Tension building nicely.
