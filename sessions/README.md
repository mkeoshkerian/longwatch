# Session 1 - 2026-01-20

## Summary
The Prometheus departed Ganymede orbit and initiated humanity's first 
interstellar FTL jump. First day in warp was tense but uneventful. 
Discovered one of the corporate observers asking unusual questions 
about FTL systems.

## Key Events
- Successful FTL jump initiation from Ganymede
- Brief ceremony marking historic moment
- Corporate observer Dr. Chen seen near engineering repeatedly
- Chief Engineer expressed concerns about Dr. Chen's questions

## Decisions Made
- Chose not to confront Dr. Chen yet—gathering more information
- Authorized increased security monitoring of engineering section

## NPCs Introduced
- Dr. Wei Chen (Han-Lockheed observer) - Physicist, asking too many 
  questions about FTL configuration
- Lt. Commander Okafor (Chief Engineer) - Competent, suspicious of 
  corporate presence

## Canon Established
- Jump initiation feels like "reality folding" - brief disorientation
- Ship AI is named ARTEMIS

## Open Threads
- What is Dr. Chen really after?
- Is this standard corporate curiosity or active espionage?

## Notes
Good tension established. The isolation is starting to feel real.

## Important

After each session, review what was established and update the relevant world bible files. New NPCs should get entries. New facts about technology, locations, or factions should be recorded.

The world bible is the source of truth. Keep it current.
